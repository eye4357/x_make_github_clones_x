# Changelog â€” Walter White's Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_github_clones_x live here. We align with [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning, because even clone jobs need discipline.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Authored a Walter White-styled README and changelog to standardize clone operations for the Road to 0.20.0 campaign.
- Linked the automation rig to the change-control nexus and compliance visitor for faster situational awareness.

### Changed
- Documented expectations around retry strategies and label filters so contributors stop improvising in production.
